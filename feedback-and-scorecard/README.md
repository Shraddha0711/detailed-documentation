# Feedback App

This repository contains the code for the **Feedback App**. It uses Docker Compose for easy setup, and Docker Swarm for managing secrets and scaling services.

## Overview

This project is a containerized feedback application built using Docker. The application is designed to run within a Docker container, and Docker Compose is used to manage multiple services such as the app itself and any associated secrets.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up this application, you will need the following:

- **Docker**: Make sure Docker is installed. You can install it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Docker Compose**: Used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. Make sure you have Docker Compose installed along with Docker.
- **Docker Swarm**: Docker Swarm mode is required to manage secrets. You can enable Swarm mode by running `docker swarm init`.

Once Docker is installed and configured, proceed to the next steps.

---

## Setting Up Secrets

### Step 1: Initialize Docker Swarm

Docker Swarm mode is required for managing secrets. If you haven't already initialized Docker Swarm, run the following command:

```bash
docker swarm init
```

### Step 2: Create a Secret

Docker secrets are used to securely manage sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, etc. You can create a secret using the following command:

```bash
docker secret create my_secret ./google_credentials.json
```

In the example above, `my_secret` is the name of the secret, and `./google_credentials.json` is the path to the file containing the secret. This file can contain any sensitive data your application requires, such as API keys or credentials.

### Step 3: Verify the Secret

To ensure that your secret has been created successfully, you can list all available secrets with the following command:

```bash
docker secret ls
```

This will display a list of all secrets available in your Docker Swarm.

---

## Building the Docker Image

### Step 1: Build the Docker Image

You need to build the Docker image from your project directory. Make sure you have a `Dockerfile` present in your project. To build the image, use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t feedback-app-4 .
```

This will build the image and tag it as `feedback-app-4`. You can replace `feedback-app-4` with any name you'd prefer for your image.

---

## Running the Application

Once the image is built, you can run your application using Docker Compose. Docker Compose allows you to define and run multi-container applications.

### Step 1: Bring Up the Services

Run the following command to bring up the application and its services:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will:
- Build the images if they haven't been built yet.
- Start the defined services (e.g., the `my-app` service) in the background.

You can check the logs to ensure that everything is running smoothly by running:

```bash
docker compose logs
```

To stop the services, run:

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

## Docker Compose

This project uses **Docker Compose** for managing the multi-container environment.

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the application service (`my-app`), as well as the secrets it depends on. The secrets, in this case, are sensitive data (like credentials) required by the app.

### Docker Compose File Example

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  my-app:
    image: feedback-app-4
    secrets:
      - db_credential
    
secrets:
  db_credential:
    external: true
```

This file configures the application service `my-app` to use the secret `db_credential`. The secret is external, meaning it must be created manually via Docker Swarm (as explained above).

---

## Docker Swarm

Docker Swarm is used for orchestrating and managing services, especially when you need features like secret management or scaling.

### Steps to Use Docker Swarm:

1. **Initialize Docker Swarm**:
    ```bash
    docker swarm init
    ```

2. **Create Secrets**:
    You can create a secret by referencing a file containing sensitive data:
    ```bash
    docker secret create [secret_name] [file_path]
    ```

3. **List Secrets**:
    To view the secrets in the Docker Swarm, use:
    ```bash
    docker secret ls
    ```

4. **Build Docker Image**:
    Build your Docker image with:
    ```bash
    docker build -t [image-name] .
    ```

5. **Run Docker Compose**:
    Bring up the application with:
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```

---

## Conclusion

With these steps, you should be able to set up the Feedback App with Docker and Docker Swarm, using secure secrets to manage sensitive data. This setup ensures that your app is scalable, secure, and easy to deploy across multiple environments.
